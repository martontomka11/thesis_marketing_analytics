Hearing the discussion regarding having a purpose and established values is critical in addition to getting people involved with the mission.<br /><br /> The EM field is continually developing and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purpose especially on the local/town level can be very ambiguous. Therefore, knowing what your organization is and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mission is important. If the people in your own organization are unclear that imagine what everyone else thinks.

But when Trump came into office, everything changed. During the four years of the Trump presidency, Professor Joh would check Twitter five minutes before each class to find out what the 45th President had said and how it jibes with 200 years of the judicial branch interpreting and ruling on the Constitution. Acclaimed podcaster Roman Mars (99% Invisible) was so anxious about all the norms and laws being tested in the Trump era that he asked his neighbor, Elizabeth, to explain what was going on in the world from a Constitutional law perspective. Even after Trump left office, there is still so much for Roman to learn. What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law is a weekly, fun, casual Con Law 101 class that uses the tumultuous activities of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches to teach us all about the US

podcast will take you on a smart, direct, sometimes scary, sometimes profane, sometimes hilarious tour of the inner workings of American power and of the impact of our leaders and their policies on our standing in the world. Hosted by noted author and commentator David Rothkopf and featuring regulars Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School, Kori Schake of Stanford University and David Sanger of the New York Times, the program will be the lively, smart dinner table conversation on the big issues of the day that you wish you were having...without the calories. Sometimes special guests will join the conversation and always the emphasis will be on providing the unvarnished perspectives others shy away from. Deep State Radio is the insider perspective on American national security and foreign policy that you can't find anywhere else.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are enjoying this podcast, please consider becoming a member by visiting thedsrnetwork.com.\\\"},\\\"languageTag\\\":\\\"en-US\\\",\\\"artwork\\\":{\\\"width\\\":3000,\\\"height\\\":3000,\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts112/v4/da/3f/3f/da3f3fd8-22c6-c785-f94a-f57d16eb9f96/mza_469241862958664996.jpeg/{w}x{h}bb.{f}\\\",\\\"bgColor\\\":\\\"313131\\\",\\\"textColor1\\\":\\\"e1af4c\\\",\\\"textColor2\\\":\\\"f59b44\\\",\\\"textColor3\\\":\\\"be9646\\\",\\\"textColor4\\\":\\\"ce8640\\\"},\\\"completed\\\":false,\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-state-radio/id1245002955\\\",\\\"releaseDateTime\\\":\\\"2022-10-12T20:54:00Z\\\",\\\"trackCount\\\":738,\\\"displayType\\\":\\\"free\\\",\\\"createdDate\\\":\\\"2017-06-06\\\",\\\"websiteUrl\\\":\\\"http://thedsrnetwork.com\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Deep State Radio\\\",\\\"artistName\\\":\\\"The DSR Network\\\",\\\"contentRating\\\":\\\"clean\\\",\\\"subscribable\\\":true,\\\"subscriptionUrl\\\":\\\"https://buy.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/subscribePodcast?cc=us\\u0026id=1245002955\\\"}},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"1151856991\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"podcasts\\\",\\\"href\\\":\\\"/v1/catalog/us/podcasts/1151856991\\\",\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"offers\\\":[{\\\"kind\\\":\\\"get\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"STDQ\\\"}],\\\"copyright\\\":\\\"© 2022 Barstool Sports, Inc.\\\",\\\"genreNames\\\":[\\\"Government\\\",\\\"Podcasts\\\"],\\\"kind\\\":\\\"episodic\\\",\\\"seasonNumbers\\\":[],\\\"description\\\":{\\\"standard\\\":\\\"Zero Blog Thirty is a military podcast presented by Barstool  Sports that's listenable for the most crusty of veterans, the bootest of boots, or people who have never touched a weapon in their life.

The partnership is a shining example of how the public sector and voluntary organizations can come together to maximize assistance to those in need.</p>\n",

Hearing the discussion regarding having a purpose and established values is critical in addition to getting people involved with the mission.<br/><br/> The EM field is continually developing and it’s purpose especially on the local/town level can be very ambiguous. Therefore, knowing what your organization is and it’s mission is important. If the people in your own organization are unclear that imagine what everyone else thinks. FEMA set a good example with this document for other organizations to follow.</p>\n",

But when Trump came into office, everything changed. During the four years of the Trump presidency, Professor Joh would check Twitter five minutes before each class to find out what the 45th President had said and how it jibes with 200 years of the judicial branch interpreting and ruling on the Constitution. Acclaimed podcaster Roman Mars (99% Invisible) was so anxious about all the norms and laws being tested in the Trump era that he asked his neighbor, Elizabeth, to explain what was going on in the world from a Constitutional law perspective. Even after Trump left office, there is still so much for Roman to learn. What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law is a weekly, fun, casual Con Law 101 class that uses the tumultuous activities of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches to teach us all about the US Constitution.\\\\n\\\\nAll music for the show comes from Doomtree, an independent hip-hop collective and record label based in Minneapolis,
